Update ! 
Now this is my first Rails/React project ! Back-end Ruby on Rails(API)/DB Postgresql, Bootstrap 5.3.0 via CDN and Front-end React.js, using Create React App and npm.
To be able to use it you'll need to get the Rails from my other repository, Pokerails(master), and the React from this repo, branch feature/Kinoba.

In Pokerails => config/initializer/cors.rb change  
origins "http://localhost:3000" to any port you want the React server to be started on and of course start your rails server on another port.

At the moment 17/01/23 you'll have to hit refresh after logging in...
